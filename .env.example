# Copy this file to .env for local development with `netlify dev`.
# NEVER commit .env to git — it contains real secrets.

# In production, set these values in:
#   Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Site Configuration → Environment Variables

# Your GoHighLevel API key (Location API key, NOT the agency key).

# Your GHL Location ID.
# Found in: GHL → Settings → Business Profile (in the URL or page)
